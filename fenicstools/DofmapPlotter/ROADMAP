1. Parallel version now shows global indices of dof and mesh entities. It would
   be nice if pressing `g` would allow changing between local and global.
   The switch should happen on all the processes even though event will be
   registered by one. Upon the switch the screen should be screared on all 
   processes to prevent confusion. Again, this requires syncing.

2. Support for discountinuous spaces. It would be nice if the labels reflected
   from which cell the dof is comming. Parellel support for this?

3. Support for vector spaces and mixed spaces. The dof position should be 
   plotted only once. The labels are lists. There should be a distinction
   between components of the vector space, these for one group and then
   components of the next subspace. E.g. let M = V*W where V is scalar and W
   is tensor, then the label should be v/w_1, w_2, w_3.

4. Support for 1D meshes. The mesh should be plotted such that the cells are
   visible.

> The items are not sorted according to priority. However, 1D bugs me the least.
